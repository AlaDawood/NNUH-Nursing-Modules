You can read... I mean, you are reading. Sorry. It&#39;s nice to see people reading. Not a lot of people read these days. People prefer to... hear. But all this &#39;hearing&#39; is just reading for lazy people. Kids today should be prepared to pick up a book, and not just go around the whole time with all these modern... ears. Sometimes I just wanna rip people&#39;s ears off and say &#39;Read a book, for God&#39;s sake!&#39;... Well, actually I&#39;d probably say &#39;Read a book&#39; first and then rip their ears off, otherwise they wouldn&#39;t hear me, hehehe... Actually, I probably wouldn&#39;t rip their ears off at all, I&#39;m not a violent person. I like ears! Especially women ears, they&#39;re my favorite. I don&#39;t mean I collect them or anything! I don&#39;t have a big bucket of women ears hidden away somewhere. No, No, No, I&#39;m not after your ears really. Not that there&#39;s anything wrong with your ears! You know if I was some kind of mad ear person, your ears would be the pride of my... ear bucket.</span></p></body>
